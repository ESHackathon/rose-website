        <h1>ROSES</h1>
        <p>
          RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses in environmental research.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without transparent reporting, even well-designed reviews will fail to show their
          methodological strengths, undermining their utility in decision-making contexts
          (Pussegoda et al. 2017)
        </p>
        <p>
          ROSES is a collaborative initiative with the aim of improving the standards of
          reporting in evidence syntheses in the field of environment. At the core of ROSES
          is a set of detailed state-of-the art forms for ensuring evidence syntheses report
          their methods to the highest possible standards. Here you can find information about
          how to use ROSES forms for review protocols and final reports, along with detailed
          guidance on how to use the forms and how they were developed and published.
        </p>
        <p>
          This website and the ROSES initiative is relevant for anyone conducting or reviewing
          a systematic review or systematic map. Although the forms were specifically designed
          for environmental topics, ROSES is broadly applicable across disciplines, including
          reviews that use qualitative or mapping approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          ROSES forms will help review authors to ensure that all relevant methodological
          information is reported in their review, and will help editors and peer-reviewers
          to critique the reliability and validity of a review.
