          <div class="display-1 mb-3">Why is ROSES important?</div>
          <p>
            Reliable summaries of the evidence are vital in order to facilitate evidence-informed
            decision making in conservation and environmental management. The gold standard in
            evidence synthesis is widely accepted as systematic reviews and related systematic maps.
            As more systematic reviews and maps are published it is clear that there is a variability
            in how well these reviews are conducted and reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            We introduce ROSES (RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses) forms and
            flow diagram, designed specifically for systematic reviews and maps in the field of
            conservation and environmental management.
          </p>
          <p>
            ROSES forms can be used during the preparation of systematic review and map protocols and
            final reports. They make it easier to write these documents by prompting the user to ensure
            they have included the right information with the correct level of detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ROSES forms are a checklist of details that should be reported in review documentation.
            They ensure that all necessary content required by the
            <a href="http://www.environmentalevidence.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Review-guidelines-version-4.2-final-update.pdf" target="_blank">CEE Guidelines for Systematic Reviews
              in Environmental Management</a> is present and described in detail. ROSES can prevent time- and
            resource- consuming bounces of manuscripts before being sent out for peer-review.
          </p>
          <p>
            ROSES forms facilitate rapid identification of key conduct-related review information by
            journal editors, peer-reviewers and readers. This can speed up the time needed for a manuscript
            to be considered by a journal and make life easier for peer-reviewers and editors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the ROSES forms can help to drive up the quality of systematic reviews and maps by
            ensuring that review authors need to report methods for major steps in the review process.
            This transparency makes it hard to hide substandard methods.

          <div class="display-1 mb-3">Who created ROSES?</div>
          <p>
            ROSES was created by a team of researchers and editors with a background in evidence synthesis
            in the field of conservation and environmental management. The Collaboration for Environmental
            Evidence identified a need for standards to ensure that systematic reviews and maps (and their
            protocols) reported the right information with the correct level of detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team realised that this could also help reviewers to write protocols and reports more easily,
            by summarising and linking to guidance on systematic reviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            They knew of reporting standards that existed for other fields (like <a href="http://www.prisma-statement.org/" target="_blank">PRISMA</a>),
            but realised that environmental syntheses were often quite different. By combining
            state-of-the-art guidance for systematic reviews and maps in the field of environment with existing
            reporting standards, they developed the first version of ROSES. A team of experienced experts in
            systematic reviews and maps then helped to refine and improve ROSES.
          </p>
          <p>
            And so ROSES was born!

          <ul class="ml-3 mb-3">
            <li>
              ROSES has been developed specifically for environmental syntheses, and the forms have been
              designed for systematic maps and common types of environmental evidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES has much more fine detail in its reporting requirements, linking to specific guidance
              from the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES requires a higher standard of conduct for evidence synthesis than other reporting
              standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES reduces the emphasis on quantitative synthesis, recognising the value of other
              methods.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES allows for many other types of synthesis, e.g. reviews containing a narrative synthesis
              only.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES uses consistent, accurate and up-to-date terminology.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES focuses on both internal validity (study quality) and external validity (generalisability)
              during the reporting of critical appraisal.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES provides basic methodological guidance and links directly to the
              <a href="http://www.environmentalevidence.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Review-guidelines-version-4.2-final-update.pdf" target="_blank">CEE Guidelines for
                Systematic Reviews in Environmental Management</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              ROSES includes reporting of key meta-data (descriptive information) relating to how the review
              was conducted. This facilitates peer-review and critical appraisal of the review itself.

          <p>
            ROSES was developed in a collaboration with experts from the Collaboration for Environmental
            Evidence, Stockholm Environment Institute, and the journal Environment International. Formally,
            all reviewer authors must now complete a ROSES form when they submit their protocol, review or
            map to the CEE journal Environmental Evidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope that ROSES will be seen as valuable reporting standards across a wide variety of other
            organisations in the future.

          <p>
            Over time, ROSES will need to be updated as standards improve and we receive feedback. ROSES can
            be readily updated via this website, with a peer-reviewed article necessary for any major changes
            to the pro forma.
          </p>
          <p>
            ROSES can be extended through the development of specific tools for aspects of reporting, such as
            for qualitative synthesis or quantitative synthesis. These extensions would be related to ROSES but
            would be independent tools for particular steps in a review.
